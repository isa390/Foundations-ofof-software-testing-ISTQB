  在这个章节，我们将引导你知道测试原理：为什么测试是必要的；它的边界、目标和意图；测试背后的基本原理；测试人员面对的过程；还有测试人员必须在他们工作考虑到的一些心理因素。通过阅读这个章节，你将增加理解测试中的基本原理而且懂得这些基本原理意味着什么。
第一章
1.1 为什么测试是必要的？（1）举一个例子描述，软件里面有一个缺陷对于个人、环境和公司可以造成伤害。（2）认识到缺陷产生的根本原因及其影响之间的关系。（3）通过列举实例诠释了测试的必要性。（4）论述了测试是质量保证必不可少的一部分，以及列举了测试是如何改进质量的。（5）

I 1.1 WHY IS TESTING NECESSARY? 1 Describe, with examples, the way in which a defect in software can cause harm to a person, to the environment or to a company. (K2) 2 Distinguish between the root cause of a defect and its effects. (K2) 3 Give reasons why testing is necessary by giving examples. (K2) 4 Describe why testing is part of quality assurance and give examples of how testing contributes to higher quality. (K2) 5 Recall the terms 'mistake', 'defect', 'fault', 'failure' and the correspon ding terms 'error' and 'bug'. (Kl) 6 Explain the fundamental principles in testing. (K2)

1.1.1 Introduction In this section, we're going to kick off the book with a discussion on why testing matters. We'll describe and illustrate how software defects or bugs can cause problems for people, the environment or a company. We'll draw important distinctions between defects, their root causes and their effects. We'll explain why testing is necessary to find these defects, how testing promotes quality, and how testing fits into quality assurance. In this section, we will also introduce some fundamental principles of testing. As we go through this section, watch for the Syllabus terms bug, defect, error, failure, fault, mistake, quality, risk, software, testing and exhaustive testing. You'll find these terms defined in the glossary.
